Overview
========

On each user profile update or creating of a new user, we call MICHLOL WS to get the user's role in the organization:
96 = management
3 = teacher
no number = student (as we use MICHLOL WS #9 for management and academic stuff only)

Above values are updated in the "department" user profile field.

Note: Error in user id number will result in "no-status" value set into the user "department" field.
